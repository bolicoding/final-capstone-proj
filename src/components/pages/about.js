        <p>
          We opened with the hope of becoming a successful mechanic shop and
          that lead to an amazing journey. Fast Garage now has its very own race
          team: FG Sport. We've raced at 3 Utah Enduros and been on the podium
          twice. As a team we aim to please our clients and show them what we're
          all about. Excellence. We specialize in German automobiles but can
          work on just about anything.
